### Example Calculation

With default values:
- **Initial Capital:** â‚¬100
- **Annual Return Rate:** 10%
- **Monthly Savings:** â‚¬10

**Results after 3 years:**

| Year | Starting Capital | Annual Deposit | Interest Earned | Ending Capital | Total Invested |
|------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1    | â‚¬100            | â‚¬120           | â‚¬10             | â‚¬230           | â‚¬220           |
| 2    | â‚¬230            | â‚¬120           | â‚¬23             | â‚¬373           | â‚¬340           |
| 3    | â‚¬373            | â‚¬120           | â‚¬37             | â‚¬530           | â‚¬460           |

## How It Works

### Calculation Formula

The calculator uses a year-by-year compound interest approach:

```
Interest Earned = Starting Capital Ã— Annual Rate
Annual Deposit = Monthly Savings Ã— 12
Ending Capital = Starting Capital + Annual Deposit + Interest Earned
Monthly Income = Ending Capital Ã— Annual Rate / 12
```

### Key Concepts

- **Starting Capital**: The amount at the beginning of each year (previous year's ending capital)
- **Annual Deposit**: Your total yearly contributions (monthly savings Ã— 12)
- **Interest Earned**: Returns generated on your starting capital for that year
- **Ending Capital**: Total value at year-end (becomes next year's starting capital)
- **Total Invested**: Cumulative sum of all your contributions (initial + deposits)
- **Monthly Income**: Potential passive income if you stopped contributing

## Installation

No installation required! Just download and open:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/investment-calculator.git

# Open in your browser
open investment-calculator.html
```

Or serve with a local server:

```bash
# Using Python
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Then navigate to
# http://localhost:8000/investment-calculator.html
```

## Usage

1. **Adjust Input Values**
   - Set your initial capital (if any)
   - Choose your expected annual return rate
   - Enter your monthly savings amount

2. **View Results**
   - Charts update automatically
   - Scroll through the 30-year projection table
   - See monthly passive income potential

3. **Experiment**
   - Try different scenarios
   - Compare return rates
   - See the impact of starting capital

## Testing

The calculator includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure accuracy.

### Run Tests

Open `investment-calculator.test.html` in your browser to run all tests automatically.

### Test Coverage

- âœ… Year-by-year calculation accuracy
- âœ… Interest earned formula
- âœ… Total invested accumulation
- âœ… Monthly income calculation
- âœ… Initial capital handling
- âœ… Data structure validation
- âœ… Edge cases (zero savings, different rates)

**Example Test Results:**
```
âœ“ Year 1: Starting=100, Deposit=120, Interest=10, Ending=230, Invested=220
âœ“ Year 2: Starting=230, Deposit=120, Interest=23, Ending=373, Invested=340
âœ“ Year 3: Starting=373, Deposit=120, Interest=37, Ending=530, Invested=460
âœ“ Ending capital equals starting + deposit + interest
âœ“ Interest earned equals starting capital Ã— annual rate
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Calculation Method

Unlike simple compound interest formulas, this calculator uses **annual compounding with regular deposits**:

- Each year's interest is calculated on the starting capital only
- Monthly deposits accumulate throughout the year
- The ending capital becomes the next year's starting capital
- This provides a realistic view of how investments grow over time

### Why This Approach?

This method accurately reflects real-world investment scenarios where:
- You make regular monthly contributions
- Interest compounds annually on your capital
- Returns are calculated on the balance at the start of each period

## Browser Compatibility

Works on all modern browsers:
- âœ… Chrome 90+
- âœ… Firefox 88+
- âœ… Safari 14+
- âœ… Edge 90+

## Customization

### Modify Defaults

Edit the HTML file to change default values:

```html
<input type="number" id="initialCapital" value="100" min="0" step="100">
<input type="number" id="annualReturn" value="10" min="0" max="100" step="0.1">
<input type="number" id="monthlySavings" value="10" min="0" step="10">
```

### Change Time Horizon

Modify the calculation period (default: 30 years):

```javascript
const maxYears = 30; // Change this value
```

### Styling

All CSS is embedded in the HTML file. Look for the `<style>` section to customize:
- Colors
- Chart dimensions
- Table styling
- Layout breakpoints

## Use Cases

- ðŸ“ˆ **Retirement Planning**: Project your nest egg growth
- ðŸ’¡ **Goal Setting**: See how long to reach financial targets
- ðŸŽ“ **Financial Education**: Understand compound interest visually
- ðŸ”„ **Scenario Comparison**: Test different savings strategies
- ðŸ“Š **Investment Analysis**: Evaluate expected returns

## Limitations

- Assumes constant annual return rate (markets vary)
- Does not account for inflation
- No tax considerations
- Simple annual compounding (actual investments may compound differently)
- Fixed monthly contribution amounts

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This is a simple educational tool, but improvements are always appreciated.

### Ideas for Enhancement

- [ ] Add inflation adjustment
- [ ] Support different compounding frequencies (monthly, quarterly)
- [ ] Export data to CSV
- [ ] Multiple investment scenarios side-by-side
- [ ] Tax-adjusted calculations
- [ ] Variable contribution amounts over time
